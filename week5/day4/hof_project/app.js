// The output would be -32 -16 100 101 102 997 because the code filters out all numbers between 10 and 100

// The out put would be Hello Febin, Bryan, Aly, Andy! because the code separates each name, but them together in the same sentence, and then has Hello placed before the list of names are printed.
