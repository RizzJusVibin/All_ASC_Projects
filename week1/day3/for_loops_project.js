//Question 1 Answer, the output would be cute puppies
//Question 2 Answer, when the value of j = the value of counter, the output would be 'Bye Bye'
//Question 3 a Answer, the for loop is for i to be constantly be raised by one when it is less than the length of the array, and when i goes up by one, the index of the array in that for loop will go up by i and the second number goes up by one
//Question 3 b Answer, the result is the number in the index of the array that i is equal to divided by a number always going up by one in the loop

//Question 4
//Task 1, the output will be two of the same number until 5 1,2,3,4
//Task 2, the output will be two numbers, one with values until 24 and another until value 60
